## Here is my folder for Spring projects 


- pagination is a simple program that I tested how pagination works
- toDoList is a legacy project where I use a servlet and JDBC to make my simple site ToDo list
- yearsPercentages is a telegram bot that every day when I wake up sends me a message about how many days pass in a year
